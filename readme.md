# gm82snd
This is a replacement audio engine for Game Maker 8.1. Adding the extension completely replaces the builtin sound functions, bringing the audio engine near up to spec with GM:Studio.

Read the [included manual](readme.txt) for usage instructions.

### notes
This extension requires [gm82core](https://github.com/omicronrex/gm82core), so install that as well.

Moreover, usage of this extension is bound by Firelight's licensing terms due to usage of legacy [FmodEx](https://www.fmod.com) technology.
